*Intended for participants of web-development workshop, RAIT*

Web development is a platform from where most of us embark our journey towards the technical aspects of the IT industry. Even at times of placement interviews, these concepts play a very vital role as most of the candidates add these web-development projects in their resume. So let's being our journey of exploring out the web.    
So these reasons plus the fact that web-development is a part of Mumbai University curriculum should engender enough motivation for us to start off :smile:
