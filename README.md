### Hi, I am Avinash, a PhD candidate at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY :man_student:

My research interests broadly spans across large-scale high-frequency data-management 
on parallel and distributed high-performance computing systems. Currently, I am working 
on optimizing I/O across deep tiers of memory hierarchy for large-scale scientific 
experiments. 

Attending SC'22? See our work at the [doctoral showcase symposium](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=drs105&sess=sess250).
